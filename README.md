## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the Bobs & Bangs website is to provide information about the company, what services they offer and how they can book appointment or contact the company.
The design of the website should also reflect the style of the hair salon: a blended mixture of feminine and masculine features.
<br>
Features include images and videos of the hair salon and the two owners, Tilda (hair stylist) and Mathias (barber and skin care professional), modal button on the front page and a booking page 
to easily book appointments, reviews from customers, social links to provide an alternative way to learn more about the company and to get more 'peer reviews', and a contact page with numerous ways to
contact the company.
<br>
Bobs & Bangs has three target audiences: New customers, retained customers and potential new employees (hair stylist, barbers or skin care professionals).

#### User Goals

#### Developer and Business Goals

- A well-thought-out and professional design of the website that attracts new and retained customers and also potential new employees.
- A fun, creative and stylish project that reflects the developer's use of HTML and CSS, with a hint of Javascript.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the website should be one that attracts people from all walks of life, with a blended mixture of feminine and masculine characteristics.

**Structure**

- The header is always fixed on the top of the pages of the website, containing the company logo on the left-hand side and the navigation bar on the right-hand side.
- The footer is always located at the bottom of the pages on the website, containing the company's contact information (visiting address, phone number and e-mail address), opening hours, 
social links to Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and LinkedIn. It also contains the developer's disclaimer and LinkedIn page.
- All of the pages can only be scrolled vertically and not scroll horizontally.
- From left to right, the navigation bar is in the order of importance: Home page, About page, Services page, Contact page and Booking page:
    1. The Home page is the first page that the user lands on when they enter the website. This page acts like an introductory page for user and it should be obvious within seconds on what kind of
    website this is. This developer used a hero section on this page, where they placed the background image, company title and slogan, a modal button and highlighted text about special offers
    to entice the user to book an appointment now. When user scrolls down further, they will also find a customer review carousel so that the users can get feedback from other 
    customers who have used the company's services. Both the hero and the customer review section is aligned at the center of the page. On tablet and mobile screens, the background image is 
    removed in order to create less clutter on the page.
    2. The About page is the second page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to read more about who is behind the company and what their values are. Users will also find an 
    image carousel that gives them an insight on how it looks inside the hair salon/barbershop. On larger desktop screens, the image carousel is floating on the right, next to the paragraphs. 
    On smaller desktop screens or on larger tablet screens, the paragraphs wrap around the image carousel. On mobile screens, the image carousel is placed under the paragraphs.
    3. The Services page is the third page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to know what services the company offers and to what price. These are listed in a table.
    They can also find videos with controls but muted and on loop. The videos show the faces behind the people who perform the services. On desktop and tablet screens, the videos are floating 
    on the right, next to the tables. On mobile screens, the videos are placed right under each table, respectively.
    4. The Contact page is the fourth page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to see all the numerous communication channels that the company offers. 
    The following is structured on desktop and tablet screens: On the top-left, they find the e-mail address for job seekers. On the top-right, they find information om what to do when they 
    want to rebook/cancel an appointment. Under that, they find a contact form as an alternative option to contact the company and right under that, they find an embedded Google map that 
    shows the location of the hair salon/barbershop. On mobile screens, each of these parts are vertically aligned.
    5. The Booking page is the fifth and last page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to book an appointment. This is an alternative way to book other than via the modal button 
    on the Home page. It is the exact same form as the one on the Home page with 7 input fields and one Submit-button. The structure of this form is consistent on all screen sizes.

**Backgrounds**

- The dark charcoal background colour that covers all pages of the website was chosen to represent the masculine characteristics of the hair salon but also to make the other elements on the page 
stand out more.
- The background image for the hero section on the Home page was chosen to reflect the rustic aesthetic of the hair salon. The image of the brush, scissors and razors on the wooden table
complements the text in the hero section, "Bobs", "Bangs" and "cut".

**Fonts**

- The primary font called **Major Mono Display** initially attracted the developer because of the monospace makes the text for the heading elements clear and readable in any size. 
It was the design of the uppercase typeface that made this font the ultimate choice because it gives room for colour to be added in a stylish way.
- The secondary font called **Roboto** was chosen because it was one of the popular pairings according to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Major+Mono+Display) but also 
because the compact design complements the primary font.

**Colours**

- The two primary colours of light purple (#b288ca) and darker shade of white ('blanchedalmond') were chosen for the company logo, company title, icons, form borders, heading elements 
and most of the paragraph elements because the light purple colour represents the feminine feeling of the hair salon and the darker shade of white contrast the purple colour well.
- The standard black colour for the text and the light brown ('burlywood') background colour were used for the mark element, which is considered not a permanent element of the website. 
This element is used to inform the user's that the company currently has a discount offer and the colours make the element stand out from the rest of the website. 
It also makes the user's focus drawn straight to the discount offer.
- To meet the accessibility guideline's contrast ratio, a darker purple colour (#24152c) is used for the button's background colour to contrast the white ('white') foreground text colour. 
When the button is hovered, the colours switches places, i.e. the white ('white') colour is used for the button's background colour to contract the darker purple colour (#24152c) foreground 
text colour.

**Icons**

- Icons were used for the social links in the footer element and for the customer reviews in the Home page. They were chosen because they are universally understood and because
their obvious meaning and purpose removes the need for descriptive text.

**Images**

- The images were chosen for the About page to give the users an insight on what it is like inside the hair salon.
- Images were also chosen for mobile screens on the Services page to show the faces behind the people who perform the services. 
These images complement the tables that lists all of the services that is offered to all customers. 

**Videos**

- The videos were chosen for tablet and desktop screens on the Services page to show the faces behind the people who perform the services. The videos also show the owners interacting with their 
customer. These videos complement the tables that lists all of the services that is offered to all customers. 

### Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The first version of the mobile and desktop mockups was made during the design and planning process for this project. 
The second version of the mobile and desktop mockup was made when the project was almost at the point of completion.

- [First version](https://github.com/potterjane/bobs-and-bangs/blob/29beb82abe6f7bced87dd899abb743d32003d710/wireframes/bb-wireframes-version-1.pdf)

### Existing Features

1. **Booking modal**
    - This Bootstrap modal can be found on the Home page. The modal opens only when the user clicks on the "Book Now" button in the hero section.

    - The users can also choose to close the modal by clicking on the modal “backdrop”.

</div>

2. **Review and image carousel**
    - Bootstrap's carousels were used in two places, one for the customer reviews in the Home page and on for the images in the About page. 
    - It gives the website a sense of movement and removes the hassle of scrolling through several images and reviews, manually.
    - This feature allows users to control the transition duration by holding down on the review/image.

3. **Navigation bar for desktop and mobile**
    - Standard navigation bar is used for desktop screens, aligned on the top-right side of all the pages.
    - Bootstrap's 'hamburger' navbar is used to collapse the navigation content for mobile and tablet screens. This is to remove any unneccesarry clutter for the users.
    - This feature allows users to easily navigate through each part of the website with minumum number of clicks.
