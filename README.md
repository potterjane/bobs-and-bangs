## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of Bobs & Bangs website is to provide information about the company, what services they offer and how they can book appointment or contact the company.
The design of the website should also reflect the style of the hair salon: a blended mixture of feminine and masculine traits.
Features include images and videos of the hair salon and the two owners, Tilda (hair stylist) and Mathias (barber and skin care professional), modal button on the front page and a booking page 
to easily book appointments, reviews from customers, social links to provide a different way to learn more about the company and get more peer reviews, and a contact page with various way to
contact the company.
Bobs & Bangs has three target audiences: New customers, retained customers and potential new employees (hair stylist, barbers or skin care professionals).

#### User Goals

A new customer's goals are:
- A good-looking website that is simple and
- Easy and quick 

#### User Stories

As a new customer, I want:
1. 

As a retained customer, I want:
1. To be able to book an appointment with as little clicks as possible, so that I spend as little of my time as day booking an appointment. 

As a hair stylist/barber looking for a new place of work, I want:
1. To be able to 

#### Site Owner Goals

The couple that owns the hair salon/barbershop wants the website to reach out to new and retained customers but also to potential new employees (hair stylist, barbers and 
skin care professionals) that are interesting in working at the company.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the website should be one that attracts people from all walks of life, with a blended mixture of feminine and masculine characteristics.

**Backgrounds**

- The dark charcoal background colour that covers all pages of the website was chosen to represent the masculine feeling of the hair salon but also to make the other elements on the page 
stand out more.
- The background image for the hero section on the Home page was chosen to reflect the rustic aesthetic of the hair salon. The image of the brush, scissors and razors on the wooden table
complements the text in the hero section, "Bobs", "Bangs" and "cut".

**Fonts**

- The primary font called **Major Mono Display** was initially attractive for the developer because of the monospace makes the text for the heading elements clear and readable in any size. 
It was the design of the uppercase typeface that made this font the ultimate choice because it gives room for colour to be added in a stylish way.
- The secondary font called **Roboto** was chosen because it was one of the popular pairings according to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Major+Mono+Display) but also because the compact design complements the primary font.

**Colours**

- The two primary colours of light purple (#b288ca) and darker shade of white ('blanchedalmond') were chosen for the company logo, titles, icons, buttons, table borders, heading elements 
and most of the paragraph elements because the light purple colour represents the feminine feeling of the hair salon and the darker shade of white contrast but complements the purple colour well.
- The standard black colour for the text and the light brown ('burlywood') background colour were used for the mark element, which is considered not a permanent element of the website. 
This element is used to inform the user's that the company currently has a discount offer and the colours make the element stand out from the rest of the website. 
It also makes the user's focus drawn straight to the discount offer.

**Icons**

- Icons were used for the social links in the footer element and for the customer reviews in the Home page. They were chosen because they are universally understood and because
their obvious meaning and purpose removes the need for text for explanation.

**Images**

- The images were chosen for the About page to give the users an insight on what it is like inside the hair salon.

**Videos**

- The videos were chosen for the Services page to show the faces of the owners and (currently) the sole employees of the hair salon. The videos also show the owners working with their 
respective customer. The videos complement the tables that lists all of the services that is offered to all customers. 

### Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The first version of the mobile and desktop mockups was made during the design and planning process for this project. 
The second version of the mobile and desktop mockup was made when the project was almost at the point of completion.

1. **Booking modal**
    - This Bootstrap modal can be found on the Home page. The modal opens only when the user clicks on the "Book Now" button in the hero section.

2. **Review and image carousel**
    - Bootstrap's carousels were used in two places, one for the customer reviews in the Home page and on for the images in the About page. 
    - It gives the website a sense of movement and removes the hassle of scrolling through several images and reviews, manually.
    - This feature allows users to control the transition duration by holding down on the review/image.
